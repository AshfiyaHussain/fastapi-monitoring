Implementation of Metrics Tracking and Visualization

1. Tracking Metrics in FastAPI
Metrics are tracked using the prometheus_client library, which integrates seamlessly with FastAPI. The implementation includes:

a. Instrumenting API Endpoints
The application tracks key performance metrics using Prometheus instrumentation:

Request Count (request_count): Tracks the number of requests per endpoint.
Error Count (error_count): Counts the failed API calls.
Request Latency (request_latency_seconds): Measures request duration as a histogram.
A middleware wraps API requests to observe these metrics and expose them via /metrics.

b. Prometheus Integration
Prometheus scrapes metrics from http://fastapi-app:8000/metrics, as configured in prometheus.yml.
Example scrape job:

yaml
Copy
Edit
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'fastapi-app'
    metrics_path: '/metrics'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['fastapi-app:8000']
2. Visualizing Metrics in Grafana
Grafana provides a pre-configured FastAPI Metrics Dashboard that visualizes:

Response times (min, max, avg)
Request counts per endpoint
Error rates over time
Accessing the Dashboard
Navigate to http://localhost:3000
Go to Dashboards â†’ FastAPI Metrics
This setup ensures real-time monitoring of API performance and error trends.
